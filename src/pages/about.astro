  <p>
    Welcome to my profile page! I am a Software Engineer and Developer
    specializing in modern web application development and enterprise systems.
    With extensive experience in full-stack development, I combine comprehensive
    technical expertise with a strong business understanding to create
    innovative and scalable digital solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout my career as a developer, I have mastered various programming
    languages and modern technologies. On the backend side, I am proficient in
    PHP with the Laravel framework to build robust and scalable systems. My deep
    experience with modern PHP allows me to implement clean architecture, design
    patterns, and SOLID principles to create maintainable code.
  </p>

  <p>
    JavaScript and TypeScript are my primary tools for modern frontend
    development. I use React.js and Next.js to build dynamic and responsive
    interfaces, focusing on performance and user experience. TypeScript provides
    additional security through static typing, enabling the development of more
    reliable and maintainable applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    My expertise in Go (Golang) brings a new dimension to microservices
    development and high-performance applications. Golang is my preferred choice
    for building services that require concurrent processing and low latency. I
    have implemented various projects using Go, from REST APIs to real-time
    systems with WebSockets.
  </p>

  <p>
    In frontend development, I have expertise in various modern frameworks,
    including:
  </p>

  <h3>Full-stack Development Expertise</h3>
  <ul class="skills-list">
    <li>React.js and its ecosystem (Redux, React Query, React Router)</li>
    <li>Vue.js for applications that require a lightweight approach</li>
    <li>Next.js for applications that need SSR and SEO optimization</li>
    <li>Nuxt.js as an alternative Vue-based framework</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    My experience with these frameworks allows me to choose the most suitable
    technology for each project based on its specific requirements.
  </p>

  <p>On the backend side, my portfolio of frameworks includes:</p>

  <ul class="skills-list">
    <li>Laravel for enterprise PHP application development</li>
    <li>Express.js and NestJS for Node.js backend</li>
    <li>Gin and Echo for Go services development</li>
    <li>Django for Python projects</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This diversity allows me to select the optimal technology stack based on the
    project's needs.
  </p>

  <br />

    implementing CI/CD pipelines, and orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes.
    I have experience with cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and
    Digital Ocean, as well as proficiency in implementing monitoring and logging
    systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    My background in accounting and business administration provides a unique
    advantage, allowing me to understand not only the technical aspects but also
    the business implications of every solution developed. I can translate
    complex business requirements into effective and efficient technical
    solutions.
  </p>

    <li>PostgreSQL for enterprise applications requiring advanced features</li>
    <li>MySQL/MariaDB for general-purpose web applications</li>
    <li>MongoDB for use cases requiring schema flexibility</li>
    <li>Redis for caching and real-time features</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I am an enthusiastic learner who continuously keeps up with the latest
    technological advancements. My commitment to lifelong learning ensures that
    the solutions I develop always incorporate best practices and relevant
    technologies. I believe that the combination of technical expertise,
    business understanding, and continuous learning is the key to delivering
    digital solutions that truly add value.
